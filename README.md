SunKnights Minecraft had been shutdown.

Since launch in 2016, Sunknights Minecraft has been online 24/7 offering Minecraft gaming experience for our players. Sunknights is a gaming clan which was formed because of a popular game called Diep.io. Later, a few Minecraft gamers in the clan thought about creating a Minecraft server for clanmates and players around the world to enjoy Minecraft together.

Unfortunately, Sunknights Minecraft server was shut down on August 27, 2021 due to funding issues. Throughout the past few years, we have gone through a lot, players come and goes, staff comes and goes, leaving behind legacies all over the blocky surfaces within SunKnights Minecraft.

As the Discord Owner (LOOHP) and Admin (Flucus4415), we would like to thank the 4 owners which had funded and contributed to the server throughout the 5 years of running the server. Without Seveska (Founding Owner), SunKnights Minecraft wouldn't have existed. Thanks to lllkrazaklll (2nd Owner), for all the ideas of pushing the server forward. Thanks to NARLIAR (4th Owner), for the magnificent spawn area which you've built for survival. And thanks to Anokuu (Clan Leader, 3rd & 5th Owner), for starting the amazing community of SK. And of course, the many donors which had supported us during the years.

Finally, thank you all members for supporting us! Even we have shortcomings, such as server maintenance, updates, and security. Without your support, it would be difficult for us to find the determination to run the server.

Players can download the survival maps of different seasons and the Sun Knights Happy Christmas Resource Pack. You can learn about our latest news on Discord.
